Welcome to the **`Noti.py`**


This script is to see and copy the port number of port forwarding servers of Private Internet Access.

##### To run open Terminal and type `python Noti.py`

These are the servers:

> 1. Canada Montreal
> 2. Canada Toronto
> 3. Canada Vancouver
> 4. Czech Republic
> 5. France
> 6. Germany Berlin
> 7. Germany Frankfurt
> 8. Isreal
> 9. Romania
> 10. Spain
> 11. Sweden
> 12. Switzerland


_If it the port number is not assigned then this is shown_.

_Otherwise_ 

![Success](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhqfxgoeo/image/upload/v1546158157/a.png)


You can only see port number first time you connect to the server. Any subsequent runs of this script will give Fetch errors.
This is because PIA has a very vauge API for this purpose. **`It is only for macOS`**.


`I wrote this because currently PIA's native mac application's (v82 Oct 3rd 2018) feature to see the port is broken.`
