This script is to see and copy the port number of port forwarded servers of Private internet access.

_If it the port number is not assigned then this is shown_.

You can only see port number first time you connect to the server. Any subsequent runs of this script will give Fetch errors.
This is because PIA has a very vauge API for this purpose. **`It is only for macOS`**.
